# Bottery
A Java based framework for chatbots

The goal of this framework is to provide a framework for writing chat service neutral bots without the need of a cloud 
environment. Currently the projects tries to provide basic plumbing like i18n, message storage and configuration as well
as a framework for simple scripted bots. The api already allows for using nlp and machine learning but will provide 
implementations on a later.
